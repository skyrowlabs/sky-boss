"""A job that checks the repository out can read it.

**An explicit `permissions:` block sets every scope it does not name to
`none`.** That is GitHub's documented rule, and it turns a block written to
*grant* something into one that also *revokes* everything else. A block naming
only `pull-requests: write` leaves the token with no `contents` scope at all.

The failure that produces is decided by a fact no file states: whether the
repository is public. A public repository's contents can be fetched without the
scope, so `actions/checkout` succeeds and the omission is invisible. A private
one answers `Repository not found`. `pr-draft-discipline.yml` shipped exactly
that block and was green in sky.boss, the one public adopter, and red on every
pull request in four private ones — found on the first `develop`→`main` pull
requests, which is the first time most of those trees had opened one.

`actionlint` does not model it, and could not settle it here anyway: what makes
it fail is the account's visibility setting, and skeletor's own verifier only
ever sees the template. So the rule is held in the tree, over every job in every
workflow, where an adopter who edits a permissions block meets it.

The predicate is narrow on purpose. No `permissions:` anywhere is the default
token and is not checked; `read-all` and `write-all` include contents; a mapping
must name `contents`. A job-level block replaces the workflow's, as GitHub
applies it, rather than merging with it.
